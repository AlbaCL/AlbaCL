### Maybe you've heard of me if...

**...you work on quantum computing because...**
- I'm the coordinator of the [Quantum Spain project](https://quantumspain-project.es/en/quantum-spain/)
- Co-first authored the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computing algorithms review [link to paper](
https://doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.94.015004)
- We proposed the data re-uploading method to encode classical data into quantum circuits [link to paper](
https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2020-02-06-226)
- Simulated the 1d Ising model with a real quantum device [link to paper](
https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2018-12-21-114) and [I won a prize for it!](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-community-tutorials/blob/master/awards/teach_me_qiskit_2018/index.ipynb)

**...or you work on High Performance Computing because...**
- I advise the Barcelona Supercomputing Center about quantum computing infrastructure.
- I'm part of the EuroHPC-Joint Undertaking projects that integrate quantum computers into supercomputers [link](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/selection-six-sites-host-first-european-quantum-computers-2022-10-04_en).

**...or you work on particle physics because...**
- We hypothesize that there's a Maximal Entanglement Principle that defines Nature's interactions [link to paper](
https://doi.org/10.21468/SciPostPhys.3.5.036)

**...or you saw me on Spanish national TV...**

<br>
Alba Cervera-Lierta is a Senior Researcher at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. She earned her PhD in 2019 at the University of Barcelona, where she studied physics and an MSc in particle physics. After her PhD, she moved to the University of Toronto as a postdoctoral fellow at the AlÃ¡n Aspuru-Guizik group. She works on near-term quantum algorithms and their applications, Quantum-HPC integration, and artificial intelligence strategies in quantum physics. Since October 2021, she has been the Quantum Spain project coordinator, an initiative to boost the quantum computing ecosystem that will acquire and operate a quantum computer at the BSC-CNS.

Iâ€™m a Senior Researcher at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC-CNS). I earned my PhD in quantum computation and quantum information at the Universitat de Barcelona, where I also studied an MSc in Particle Physics. After my PhD, I moved to the University of Toronto as a postdoctoral fellow at the AlÃ¡n Aspuru-Guzik group. Two years later, I moved back to my hometown, Barcelona, as a Senior Researcher at Quantic Group. Since October 2021, I am the coordinator of the Quantum Spain project, an initiative to boost the Spanish quantum computing ecosystem that will acquire and operate a quantum computer at the BSC-CNS.

I have a great interest in quantum technologies in general and quantum computation in particular. I worked on quantum information foundations, multipartite entanglement, and particle physics. Now Iâ€™m focused on discerning near-term opportunities of quantum computation and the synergies between quantum physics and artificial intelligence.
