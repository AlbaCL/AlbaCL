Iâ€™m a Senior Researcher at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC-CNS). I earned my PhD in quantum computation and quantum information at the Universitat de Barcelona, where I also studied an MSc in Particle Physics. After my PhD, I moved to the University of Toronto as a postdoctoral fellow at the AlÃ¡n Aspuru-Guzik group. Two years later, I moved back to my hometown, Barcelona, as a Senior Researcher at Quantic Group. Since October 2021, I am the coordinator of the Quantum Spain project, an initiative to boost the Spanish quantum computing ecosystem that will acquire and operate a quantum computer at the BSC-CNS.

I have a great interest in quantum technologies in general and quantum computation in particular. I worked on quantum information foundations, multipartite entanglement, and particle physics. Now Iâ€™m focused on discerning near-term opportunities of quantum computation and the synergies between quantum physics and artificial intelligence. Iâ€™m currently working on Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) algorithms and high-dimensional quantum computation.
